## Preparation for your Cohort

Here are some suggestions when preparing for your specific module

### 1. Learn the Material

The first thing you are going to want to do is familiarize yourself with your module's material. The best place to do this is through using App Academy Open. If you have not been given access please request it from your Senior Manager. Here you will be able to study the Readings, Videos, and Projects that will be included when teaching your Module.

#### Gain Access to the Curriculum

To gain access to the curriculum you can use the Curriculum Module Tool to enroll yourself by using the month of the cohort and the week. You will need your App Academy credentials in order to log in.

You can watch this [short video walkthrough][curriculum-enroll-video] for enrolling in curriculum weeks and having those weeks render on App Academy Open.

For a more robust walkthrough you can refer to these instructions for the [Curriculum Management Tool][cmt-instructions].

Another proper option for learning the written material is through using the [Modular Curriculum][modular-curriculum] Github.However, that can be a bit more complicated. Reach out to an instructor or to your curriculum head to learn how to navigate to your module's information in that Github Repo.

If there are recorded sessions of your Module's Lectures, this may also help you to get a feel for how your module's lecture is currently administered.

### 2. Meet With The Current Module Instructor

If there is currently an instructor that teaches the module you will be taking over, feel free to Slack the current Module Instructor and ask for a meeting to learn the ins and outs of the Module. They will be able to fill in the gaps that perhaps have not been filled thus far.

### 3. Shadow the Instructor

Shadow your Module's lectures at least twice to get a feeling for the flow. If you have time you can also Shadow other modules.

If you are going to shadow another module:

1. Slack the instructor to let them know you will be Shadowing. Maybe you have questions for them as well.
2. You can [navigate to the Zoom Room][navigate-to-zoom-room] for the module by using Progress Tracker.
3. Take notes on how class is balanced between Zoom Chat Rooms, Slack, interaction with [a/A Open][app-academy-open] as well as the flow of the lectures.

### 4. Prepare for Your Lectures

Based on what you have learned, you are now ready to start preparing your lectures.
Your preparation will vary based on the Module that you will be teaching. Always keep in mind what you learned in the approach you learned in the [a/A Instructional Guide][instructional-guide]

Take a look at these [lecture tips][lecture-tips] to aid you in your preparation.

## Class Preparation

### Meet the Incoming Cohort Assistant

It is always a good idea to meet with the incoming Cohort Assistant the week prior to beginning the module. This can be done with the entire team or just you and the Cohort Assistant. This gives you the opportunity to share any changes to the curriculum as well as share what works in the module and what doesn't. It also gives the team the opportunity to find out what extra days may be needed as well as get an idea of what the incoming cohort personality and habits are.

### Setup Your Pod

Before your cohort starts, make sure to place your team into the proper Pod on Progress Tracker. You will choose the pod based on the start date of the cohort.
You can watch this [Pod Setup Video][pod-setup] and/or follow the instructions below.

#### Progress Tracker Instructions

1. Choose Pods on the left Sidebar of PT and look for the date on which the cohort began.
2. Choose that date and you will see checkboxes next to each name.
3. Check the box for each team member on the team.

This will allow them to see questions on PT for this module when choosing the Questions option.

### Add Cohort Slack Channels

Students use an external Slack to communicate and ask questions.
Reach out to the Cohort Assistant to see which external Slack channels you and your team should join for the next cohort. Add yourself as well as your Jr. Instructional Assistants to those channels before beginning the cohort.

### Release the Next Cohort Curriculum

Cohort curriculum should be released to your staff at least one week before the new cohort begins. You will need the [course ids][course-ids] and the Postman app to execute the release. Here is a link to the instructions for adding curriculum: [Add Course Content on AAO][course-content]. As an alternative, you can now tell them to enroll themselves using the [Curriculum Management Tool][curriculum-management-tool].

## Class Administration

### Before you Start Class

Make sure you have turned off all notifications on the screens you will be sharing. If there are bookmarks or links or any other material that should not be seen by students please remove them from your screen prior to class.

Mute all sounds that will interrupt your lecture, especially through Slack or your own personal SMS notifications.

### Morning Boost

Every class begins with a Morning Boost. Navigate to the proper week and day for your cohort and give your class 5-6 minutes to complete the morning boost. You may go over the answers with them afterwards if you choose and depending on time. If you need a stopwatch to monitor and share the time with the class you can download your own stopwatch app.
Here is a link for an [online stopwatch][online-stopwatch] if you don't have your own.

### Learning Objectives

Go over the Learning Objectives for the day with the class before starting the lecture and if there is time afterwards run through them again to show that you have covered them.

### How To Manage the Questions Channel

#### During Lecture

In order to maintain the pace of the class, questions should be allowed but controlled properly. During Lecture, instruct students who have long answer questions to post them in the modules `online-question` Slack channel. The Jr. TA's should be instructed to keep an eye on the lecture channel and answer appropriate questions. If chat is enabled for the cohort, keep an eye on chat for questions as well as for hands raised on Zoom. Maintain control of the length of answers for questions as well in order to maintain class pace.

#### During Pair Programming

After you have signed in to [Progress Tracker][progress-tracker], choose the `Questions` option in the Left Sidebar.
A numbered diagram of squares will be shown to indicate the Zoom rooms where students are working. The numbers in the rooms will often but not always match the Zoom Breakout Room numbers.

Monitor the floor to assure that Jr. TA's answer questions in a timely manner.
Based on the [Division of Responsibilities][division-of-responsibilities] document, if there is a question that has been waiting for 10 or more minutes and all Jr. TA's are in other rooms, it is your responsibility to enter the floor and answer that question.

#### Answering A Question from Progress Tracker

1. Navigate to [Progress Tracker][progress-tracker].
2. Choose the `Questions` Link in the left sidebar. This should display the student breakout rooms for the cohort. A square for a question will be green, yellow, or red depending on time that has passed since the button was clicked
3. Hover over the Square for the question you want to answer. When you hover, a bar should slide from the right with a `Take` label. The name(s) of the student(s) should also be displayed.
4. Click that label. Your [Avatar][gravatar], if you have one will show next to the square. This lets your teammates know you have taken the question.
5. Next on Zoom, navigate to the Breakout room for the student(s) and answer their question(s).
6. After you have completed the question(s), return to the Progress Tracker and hover over the question square with your avatar. A sidebar with `Close` should be displayed.
7. Choose `Close` to close out your question.

If there are no more long standing questions you can go back to prepping for your next lecture or any other duties you have been assigned.

### Kahoot End of Week

While it is not a requirement, creating and running a kahoot is a fun way to engage your class at the end of the week. There may already be pre-existing kahoots, or you can create your own on the a/A [Kahoot Account][kahoot-account]. If you don't know what a kahoot is you can familiarize yourself with it [here][what-is-kahoot].

## Managing Mentoring you Module Team

Part of the job of the Module Instructor is to mentor and manage a team of Jr. TA's. You may answer questions about code, give mini-lectures, as well as have them practice teach lectures in order to learn the information more thoroughly.

### Delegating Tasks

You will delegate tasks as needed to Jr. TA's. These can include curriculum updates, creating documents, running kahoots, lecturing class, training new Jr. TA's, or assigning a person to answer questions on Slack.

### Conducting One on One's

One on one's with your Jr. TA's should be conducted at least once per cohort.
This is a time where you will be able to share progress and goals with your Jr. TA.
This is also a time to ask your Jr. TA questions to find out how they are feeling and what their current goals are.

Before conducting your One on One, you should also check the Instructor Dashboard and review all comments on that Jr. TA. Check for negative comments, but also check for extraordinary comments that you will be able to share with that TA. Be sure to maintain a balance of positive and negative.

There is also a wonderful script created by Jesse Warren to find the average of the TA's overall ratings. Navigate to the TA's comments, then paste the script in the browser console to receive the results.

### Instructor Feedback Average Script

```js
totalScoreSum = 0;
limit = undefined; // change to a number to limit to a number of pages (x20 for scores)
determineCurrentPageAverage = () => {
  const pageScores = [
    ...document.querySelectorAll(
      '.MuiTypography-root.MuiTypography-h4.MuiTypography-colorTextPrimary'
    )
  ].map((ele) => parseInt(ele.innerHTML));
  totalScoreSum += pageScores.length;
  return pageScores.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / pageScores.length;
};
runningSum = determineCurrentPageAverage();
paginations = [...document.querySelector('.MuiPagination-ul').children];
paginationCount = limit
  ? limit
  : parseInt(paginations[paginations.length - 2].innerText);
for (i = 1; i < paginationCount; i++) {
  paginations = [...document.querySelector('.MuiPagination-ul').children];
  let page;
  if (i < 6) {
    page = paginations[i].children[0];
  } else {
    if (paginationCount - 2 <= i) {
      console.log('last two!');
      page = paginations[6 + i - (paginationCount - 2)].children[0];
    } else {
      page = paginations[5].children[0];
    }
  }
  page.click();
  runningSum += determineCurrentPageAverage();
}
console.log(
  'Your average score is:',
  runningSum / paginationCount,
  'across',
  totalScoreSum,
  'scores'
);
```

**Possible Questions**

1. How did you feel during the cohort
2. What are your goals in App Academy
3. What can I do to help you in any way
4. What suggestions do you have for improving the module
5. If you were to transfer modules what would be your module preference

## Culture Curriculum

There may be a Culture Curriculum moment assigned to your module. It is up to you to coordinate with the Curriculum Advisor in order to schedule proper class time for the curriculum.

## Delivering Feedback to Curriculum

You are expected to deliver feedback to curriculum as well as send updates, typos, mistakes and improvements to them.

### Correcting Mistakes in Curriculum

In order to correct mistakes that are on App Academy Open, please follow the instructions given in the [X-Curriculum-Flow][x-curriculum-guideline] guide. Refer to the `How to Contribute to Modular-Curriculum` section to understand how to use a proper git workflow on [Modular Curriculum][modular-curriculum] and create a Pull Request.

In order to expedite changes and meet the two week requirement for changes to be released on App Academy Open, make any corrections to curriculum and create your Pull Request ASAP.

After you have made a pull request, go to the `instruction_x_curriculum` channel
on Slack and mention that you have made a PR, include your Module Number along
with a short description and the PR link.

## Prep Week

If your module has a prep week, this will be a good time to meet with your team as a whole, have one on one's, do some team building, make assignments.

**Prep Week Responsibilities**

1. The first responsibility for TA's on a prep week is to help any modules that need help on the floor.
2. If there are things to improve in your regular cohort for you and your TA's this is a time to do it. (Lecture Improvements for example)
3. This can be a good time to test your next cohort's Assessment to assure it is functioning properly using the [Assessment Checker][assessment-checker] tool.
4. Some TA's may be ramping up to learning how to Lecture. This is a good time for you to have them practice lecture in front of the team and give suggestions for improvements.
5. Curriculum may have items that they would like help with. You and your team can also volunteer to help them with curriculum if all other cohort preparation needs have been met.
6. You may want to add assets to the curriculum. Here is a suggested guideline for quality and methods to making those additions. [Curriculum Developer Guide][curriculum-developer-guide]

## Releasing the Next Cohort Curriculum to the Team

It is usually a good idea to release the next cohort Curriculum for a/A Open to your Jr. TA's at least a week before the cohort begins. Instructions for doing this are located at this [Confluence Link][release-curriculum]. This will allow time for everyone to review what has been released and find mistakes that require hot fixes before start of the next curriculum.

## Assessments

Your module will most likely have one or more assessments. Assessments always occur on Mondays. If there is a Cohort Assistant or Principal Technical Mentor, you are not responsible for setting up or releasing the Assessment. However, you should know how to set up and release the assessment in the event that neither are present.

### Setup the Assessment

[Setting Up for an Assessment Instructions][setup-assessment]
[Video Instructions][setup-assessment-video]

### Release the Assessment

You will need the course id document and the Postman app to release the assessment to students

[Assessment Release Video][assessment-release-video]

### Question Answering

There are restricted answers to questions during an assessment. Please follow the protocol for [Answering Questions During An Assessment][assessment-messaging]
You should remind all involved internally of this document and procedure before the start of an Assessment.

### Scoring An Assessment

You and your team may be asked to help score an assessment.
Navigate to Progress Tracker -> Assessments -> Scores
You should see a column representing the current weeks assessment on the left.

The `fetch` option that you see at the top is meant to be used by the Cohort Assistant. This will fetch all of the current scores. Only one person should fetch due to the lag in time caused by multiple fetches.

After scores have been fetched. You can navigate to each student's scores by pressing `Score` next to their name. If the autograder is working properly, you will see scores based on what has been completed.
(Create instructions for PT score and fetching and grader sheet, manual grading)

Scores are often manually recorded by the team in a separate document created by the Cohort Assistant. Ask the Cohort Assistant for access to this document.

### Manual Grading

In the event that the AutoGrader is not working, you may be required to help manually grade the assessment. (find out how to do this)

### If A Student Needs More Time

Sometimes students are allowed more time due to pre-existing conditions or disabilities. This is usually pre-arranged with HR. The CA should have a list of these students and notify you. If not, ask for this list and give the student the proper extra time.

If a student requests more time, consult with the Cohort Assistant to arrange for it. If there is no Cohort Assistant you should reach out on Slack to the Senior Instructional Manager to receive permission to give extra time.

If a student is having machine issues that cannot be repaired quickly, note how much time passes between the machine failure and repair and return that time to the student for the Assessment. Also, in order to avoid student panic, let the student know sooner rather than later that the time will be returned to them. This will give them the same opportunity as all other students to complete the assessment.

## Bi-Weekly Checkins

You will have a bi-weekly half-hour meeting with your Senior Manager to discuss how things are progressing in your module as well as upcoming changes and additions to staff and curriculum. If you do not receive a Google Calendar invite for this regular meeting, then reach out to your Senior Manager on Slack to schedule.
